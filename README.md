Hello, I'm Jorge Valencia.

I am a self-taught Frontend Web Developer.

The portfolio I am exhibiting makes part of the courses I have completed throughout training. I have completely rewritten the code from scratch and I have learned each of the techniques and tricks reviewed.

The README files inside each directory specify the features I added to each project.

The courses I followed were taught and created by Brad Traversy. I absolutely recommend them if you are looking to make a career move into programming just like me!

Essentially, I completed 3 courses in a period of 6 months:

1. Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)
2. Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2023
3. React Front To Back

From these courses, I've gained the following technical skills: HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, JS ES6 and ReactJS.

If you'd like to follow any of these courses, I'd recommend to check out the author's Youtube channel [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia 'Traversy Media Youtube Channel') where he provides links with great discounts. Don't hesitate to check it out!

For professional enquiries or further questions about my training trajectory, you can drop me an email to my_coding_journey@outlook.com

Enjoy your visit! :-)
