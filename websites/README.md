**Disclamer:** These projects make part of the tutorials I followed as part of my training as a self-taught Frontend Web Developer.

These are the tweaks that I have implemented to the projects up to this point:

1. Use **GIT** for version control
2. Rewrite all the code using **SCSS**
3. Add **full responsiveness** capabilities to fit all screen sizes (i.e. mobile, tablet and personal computer)
